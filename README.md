# Real Estate Investment Prioritization Using Economic and Sustainability Metrics

**Capstone Project – Master of Science in Business Analytics**  
📍 Suffolk University | Jan 2025 – Apr 2025



# Project Overview

This project aimed to identify the most promising countries for international real estate investment by evaluating economic strength and sustainability factors. Our team used public data on GDP, FDI, public debt, and urban population to recommend optimal markets.

# Objectives

- Analyze macroeconomic indicators for investment suitability
- Incorporate sustainability metrics to reflect long-term value
- Use data clustering to segment countries by opportunity level
- Deliver a data-driven recommendation to stakeholders


# Tools & Technologies

- **Python** – Data cleaning, clustering (KMeans), regression
- **Excel** – Pre-analysis data wrangling
- **Tableau** – Dashboard creation & storytelling
- **Pandas, scikit-learn, matplotlib** – Python libraries used



# Methodology

1. **Data Collection**  
   - Gathered economic and environmental indicators from World Bank datasets

2. **Data Cleaning & Transformation**  
   - Cleaned and standardized variables using z-scores in Python
   - Filtered countries with high public debt or missing values

3. **Clustering Analysis**  
   - Performed KMeans clustering to group countries based on GDP, FDI, and debt
   - Identified Cluster 0 as the most promising

4. **Sustainability Filter**  
   - Compared urban population percentages within Cluster 0 countries

5. **Final Recommendation**  
   - Selected **Norway** as the optimal investment destination based on low debt (13.8%), high GDP ($485B), and 84% urbanization rate
